The dataset includes 302 images.
Stationary-Items are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Auto-contrast via contrast stretching

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -17 and +17 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.26 percent of pixels
